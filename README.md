## FAQ – Internship Mid Presentation

<details>
<summary><strong>What exactly happened during the mid internship presentation?</strong></summary>

During the mid internship presentation, we were required to prepare and present slides based on a given format. The presentation was divided into two main parts:
1. **Company Overview**
2. **Project & Internship Work**

Each intern had to explain their contribution and learning outcomes during the internship.

<details>
<summary><strong>Were the presentations individual or group-based?</strong></summary>

Although the presentation was meant to be individual, students who completed their internship at the same company were allowed to present together to avoid repetition of company details.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How was the presentation handled for students from the same company?</strong></summary>

For students interning at the same company:
- Only **one student** presented the company overview
- That student also presented their project details
- The remaining students presented **only their individual projects and learning outcomes**

This approach helped avoid repeating the same company information multiple times.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can you explain the grouping with examples?</strong></summary>

Yes. The grouping was done based on the internship company:
- 2 students from **Samsung** presented together
- 2 students from **Brain Station** presented together
- Our group had **5 students** from the same company, so we presented together
- Another group of **6 students** presented together as they belonged to the same company

Each group followed the same presentation structure to maintain consistency.

<details>
<summary><strong>Who presented the company details in your group?</strong></summary>

In our group of five interns, one person presented:
- The complete company overview
- Their project details

The rest of us focused only on presenting:
- Our individual projects
- What we worked on
- What we learned during the internship
